Shell Scripts Inside

[ MYSYNC.sh ] - Personal script

  This script help me automating the process of upload or download my personal spend sheet. First, I installed 'INSYNC' program, and then I created my script to working whith the program. This is for Personal Use!
  
[ SIVCONTROL.sh ] - Professional script

  I created this Script to facilitate the management of SIVS (Sistema de Informação de Vôo), because we have around 215 Linux 
machines executing the SIV. This script allows to run a Shell command only once for all SIVs, instead, connect one by one executing
the command. For this scripts, I needed the 'SSHPASS' program [ $whatis sshpass: noninteractive ssh password provider ]
